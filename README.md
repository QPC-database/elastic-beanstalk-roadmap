## FAQs
**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, and we want to provide our customers the insights they need to plan.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Because job zero is security and operational stability, we can't provide specific target dates for features.

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?**
* *Just shipped* - Launched and available in roughly the last six months.
* *Coming soon* - coming up.  Think a couple of months out, give or take.
* *We're working on it* - In progress, but further out.  We might still be working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.
* *Researching* - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented!  We'd love to see your use case or design ideas here.

**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: Much of our development work for AWS Elastic Beanstalk is included on this roadmap, but not everything. Of course, there will be features we are very excited about that we are going to launch without notice to surprise and delight our customers. We also don’t include every platform security update, but will include significant runtime updates (for example new major versions of Node.js).

**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue!  You can read about how to contribute [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md). Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.


**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

A: Please open an issue!
